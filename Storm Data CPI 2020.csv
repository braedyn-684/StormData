A storm system was approaching from the southwest, with moisture thrown into the cold and dry air. Rain began across the southern counties on the 7th, but it was uncertain what would fall from the sky farther north on the 8th/9th as moisture slowly increased toward the Missouri border.||The forecast was not a slam dunk because of three huge factors. First, a dry atmosphere over the northern counties was eroding moisture arriving from the south. Given this, it was difficult to know how much moisture would be available to produce snow and ice. Predicting accumulations accurately was a challenge. Second, forecast models showed a layer of above freezing air aloft. This was verified by several balloon launches on the 8th. At 600 am CST, it was 42 degrees at 4900 feet over North Little Rock (Pulaski County). At 1200 pm CST, it was still 40 degrees overhead, and 36 degrees at 300 pm CST. As long as this was happening, snow was going to melt before reaching the ground. Not knowing when this warm layer would disappear affected the snow forecast. Finally, with melting occurring, it was important to know if temperatures would stay below freezing near the ground, or warm up a little. If it was the former, then freezing rain would be a huge issue. Any warming would limit how much icing took place.||In the end, the warm layer went away late on the 8th/early on the 9th in parts of the north. This allowed snow to fall for a few hours in places.

On the 18th, part of the roof of a volunteer fire department caved in just northeast of Rison (Cleveland County). At Crossett (Ashley County), a bowling alley roof collapsed, and roofs were compromised at a packaging plant and a church. Some of this was attributed to a lot of sleet. Frozen pipes are a common concern in winter, and this became a huge problem in Mayflower (Faulkner County). Supply lines burst, and the city ran out of water. As a safeguard, many folks in central Arkansas were asked to conserve water as pipes thawed out and were subject to pressure breaks. Residents in cities such as Benton (Saline County), Hot Springs (Garland County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County) were urged to cut down on water usage due to a critically low supply.

Snow spread across the north/west from the late evening of the 16th into the predawn hours of the 17th. For the remainder of the 17th, central/southern Arkansas got in on the action, and it went nuts from Little Rock (Pulaski County) southward.||Incredibly, about fifteen inches of snow was unleashed near Sheridan (Grant County), with thirteen inches at Malvern (Hot Spring County) and Sulphur Springs (Jefferson County), and about a foot at Gurdon (Clark County), Hope (Hempstead County), and Prescott (Nevada County). Through social media, quite a few pictures were posted of tape measures and rulers penetrating through at least twenty inches of snow (the result of two storms) in yards across the south.||At 230 pm CST...This is not good. Interstate 40 (westbound) is backed up at Exit 202/Biscoe (Prairie Co), and vehicles are not moving at all. This is according to a @myARDOT traffic camera.#arwx pic.twitter.com/L2dJKvQIkd|��� NWS Little Rock (@NWSLittleRock) February 17, 2021 ||There was way too much snow along Interstate 40 near Biscoe (Prairie County). Multiple accidents led to a line of traffic miles long in the westbound lanes that sat for sixteen hours. People were forced to spend the night on the road.||This time around, Little Rock (Pulaski County) was buried with 11.8 inches of snow. At least forty flights into the airport were cancelled on the 17th, and the facility closed during the evening.||Historically, the 17th was the second snowiest day on record at Little Rock (Pulaski County) going back to the late 1800s (in the top spot was 12.0 inches on March 6, 1875). The February tally of 20.3 inches was more than any other month (topping 20.0 inches in January, 1918), and made 2020 the third snowiest year (a foot less than the 32.6 inch record in 1960). The snow depth on the morning of the 18th was 15 inches, which was tied for first place in the record book (with January 21, 1918).||There was enough water to worry about the weight of the snow stressing the roofs of some structures. On the 18th, part of the roof of a volunteer fire department caved in just northeast of Rison (Cleveland County). At Crossett (Ashley County), a bowling alley roof collapsed, and roofs were compromised at a packaging plant and a church. Some of this was attributed to a lot of sleet. Frozen pipes are a common concern in winter, and this became a huge problem in Mayflower (Faulkner County). Supply lines burst, and the city ran out of water. As a safeguard, many folks in central Arkansas were asked to conserve water as pipes thawed out and were subject to pressure breaks. Residents in cities such as Benton (Saline County), Hot Springs (Garland County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County) were urged to cut down on water usage due to a critically low supply. During the evening of the 18th, accidents along Interstate 30 led to tie ups between Benton (Saline County) and Malvern (Hot Spring County).",A COOP observer measured 8.0 inches of snow.,CSV,0.0

This front edged south into northeast Mississippi by 12 am Thursday, February 3, 2022, and then stalled. Arctic air poured into the Mid-South with patchy light freezing rain across northeast Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel overnight. A potent upper-level disturbance moved into the region and interacted with the stalled front starting early Thursday morning. A surface low developed and moved east-northeast along the front along with a shield of heavy wintry precipitation. The cold air deepened quickly across the Delta region of the Missouri Bootheel, eastern Arkansas, and extreme northwest Tennessee. The region experienced mostly sleet from this event with a widespread amount of one to two inches and isolated three-inch amounts. Transportation impacts were extensive. A corridor of heavy freezing rain was located from Phillips County, AR, through extreme northwest Mississippi, and across much of West Tennessee from Memphis to Brownsville to Paris. These areas received from one-quarter inch to three-quarters inch of ice. Significant damage occurred to the power supply infrastructure throughout this region due to widespread trees and power lines being knocked down. Light icing occurred across other parts of northwest Mississippi such as Clarksdale and along I-40 in West Tennessee to the east of Jackson, Tennessee.  Heavy rain fell along and south of the stalled arctic front across much of north Mississippi. Precipitation tapered off from west to east during the evening hours of Thursday, February 3, 2022.",Around one-quarter inch of ice resulted in tree and power line damage and power outages.,CSV,
