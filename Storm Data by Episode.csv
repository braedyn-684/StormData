Predicting accumulations accurately was a challenge. Second, forecast models showed a layer of above freezing air aloft. This was verified by several balloon launches on the 8th. At 600 am CST, it was 42 degrees at 4900 feet over North Little Rock (Pulaski County). At 1200 pm CST, it was still 40 degrees overhead, and 36 degrees at 300 pm CST. As long as this was happening, snow was going to melt before reaching the ground. Not knowing when this warm layer would disappear affected the snow forecast. Finally, with melting occurring, it was important to know if temperatures would stay below freezing near the ground, or warm up a little. If it was the former, then freezing rain would be a huge issue. Any warming would limit how much icing took place.||In the end, the warm layer went away late on the 8th/early on the 9th in parts of the north. This allowed snow to fall for a few hours in places. At Mountain View (Stone County), three inches of powder was measured, with two to three inches at Dennard (Van Buren County), and two inches at Botkinburg (Van Buren County), Calico Rock (Izard County), Leslie (Searcy County), Marshall (Searcy County), and Wayton (Newton County).||The warm layer stuck around for most of the event in the northeast, and ground temperatures hovered around 32 degrees.
