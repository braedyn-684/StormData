The front stalled along the Gulf Coast, with west winds aloft bringing a storm system from the southern Plains. The system interacted with the front late on the 17th/early on the 18th, with moisture surging northward into the cold air. The cold air was deep enough to support snow in northern Arkansas. Two to as much of six inches of snow was common in about the northern two rows of counties. In central and southern sections of the state, the cold air was more shallow, with a layer of warm air aloft. In these areas, snow fell though the warm layer and melted, but refroze as it neared the ground. The result was freezing rain and sleet.

Motorists were stranded in the traffic jam for as many as 12 to 14 hours. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe activated the Arkansas National Guard to aid the motorists. Guard armories in Benton and Malvern were opened as shelters. While the interstate technically reopened soon after 7:00 AM CST on the 10th, traffic was still only at a crawl well into the afternoon of the 10th, and traffic was still jammed on the morning of the 11th. Due to the poor driving conditions on the 10th, virtually every school in the Little Rock County Warning Area was closed, as were state and federal offices in Little Rock. Power outages during the winter storm were relatively small. The largest, affecting about 3000 customers, began during the afternoon of the 9th when a substation in southwest Little Rock suffered a failure. Power was restored during the late night hours of the 9th. Twenty-five flights were cancelled at Little Rock's Adams Field. Four traffic fatalities occurred due to icy or snowy roads. On the 9th, three single fatality accidents occurred. A 24 year-old woman was killed on Arkansas Highway 24 near Chidester in Ouachita County, a 42 year-old woman lost her life on U.S. Highway 167 north of Hampton in Calhoun County, and a 31 year-old man was killed on U.S. Highway 70 east of Hot Springs in Garland County. On the 10th, another single fatality accident occurred, killing a 50 year-old man on Arkansas Highway 86 north of Brown Grove in Prairie County.",Leola measured 6.5 inches of snow and Sheridan collected 5.5 inches.

This storm system moved out of the Texas Hill Country late on January 8th and moved into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley during the day Sunday January 9th.  An area of low pressure at the surface and in the lower levels of the atmosphere developed offshore the Southeast Texas Gulf Coast and remained offshore the Louisiana Gulf Coast during the day of the event.  This low pressure system helped to feed moisture into the region from the south.  Initially, the lower levels of the atmosphere were very dry, but lift provided by the storm system helped to moisten and cool the lower levels of the atmosphere such a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow were the result across all of South and Southwest Arkansas.  The transition from freezing rain and sleet to all snow was quick during the morning of January 9th across the region.

During the morning of the 9th, a mixture of sleet, snow, and freezing rain developed across southern Arkansas. Precipitation spread into central Arkansas before the end of the afternoon, but this far north, temperatures were cold enough such that only snow fell. During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches. On either side of the heavy snow band and from Little Rock toward Brinkley, 4 to 6 inch totals were common. Many other areas received 2 to 4 inches of snow, but amounts in northern Arkansas were less, ranging from less than an inch to 2 inches. In most places, driving conditions became hazardous within a couple of hours after precipitation began. Hundreds of accidents occurred on the afternoon and evening of the 9th. On the afternoon of the 9th, a tremendous traffic back-up occurred on Interstate 30 between Benton and Malvern. Multiple accidents caused both sides of the interstate to come to a halt.

This storm system moved out of the Texas Hill Country late on January 8th and moved into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley during the day Sunday January 9th.  An area of low pressure at the surface and in the lower levels of the atmosphere developed offshore the Southeast Texas Gulf Coast and remained offshore the Louisiana Gulf Coast during the day of the event.  This low pressure system helped to feed moisture into the region from the south.  Initially, the lower levels of the atmosphere were very dry, but lift provided by the storm system helped to moisten and cool the lower levels of the atmosphere such a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow were the result across all of South and Southwest Arkansas.  The transition from freezing rain and sleet to all snow was quick during the morning of January 9th across the region.  The storm system exited the region late on January 9th but not before dumping some impressive freezing rain, sleet and snowfall totals across the southern half of the state.  Generally, one quarter to one half inch of freezing rain and sleet was reported initially across portions of Southwest and South Central Arkansas with the snow being the predominant precipitation type during the afternoon and evening of January 9th.  Following are some snowfall totals for January 9th across South and Southwest Arkansas: 8 inches in Ashdown, 7 inches in Dierks and Nashville, 6 inches in Hope, 6 miles north of Lewisville, and Texarkana, 5 inches in Dequeen and Tolette, 4 inches in Lewisville, 2 inches in Magnolia and 1 inch in El Dorado.  There were numerous reports of traffic accidents across the southern half of the state including isolated power outages as well.","A combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow fell across Columbia County Arkansas. Freezing rain amounts ranged from between one quarter to one half inches with one half inch of sleet also reported across portions of the county.

During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches.

During the morning of the 9th, a mixture of sleet, snow, and freezing rain developed across southern Arkansas. Precipitation spread into central Arkansas before the end of the afternoon, but this far north, temperatures were cold enough such that only snow fell. During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches.

An area of low pressure at the surface and in the lower levels of the atmosphere developed offshore the Southeast Texas Gulf Coast and remained offshore the Louisiana Gulf Coast during the day of the event.  This low pressure system helped to feed moisture into the region from the south.  Initially, the lower levels of the atmosphere were very dry, but lift provided by the storm system helped to moisten and cool the lower levels of the atmosphere such a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow were the result across all of South and Southwest Arkansas.  The transition from freezing rain and sleet to all snow was quick during the morning of January 9th across the region.  The storm system exited the region late on January 9th but not before dumping some impressive freezing rain, sleet and snowfall totals across the southern half of the state.

This storm system moved out of the Texas Hill Country late on January 8th and moved into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley during the day Sunday January 9th.  An area of low pressure at the surface and in the lower levels of the atmosphere developed offshore the Southeast Texas Gulf Coast and remained offshore the Louisiana Gulf Coast during the day of the event.  This low pressure system helped to feed moisture into the region from the south.  Initially, the lower levels of the atmosphere were very dry, but lift provided by the storm system helped to moisten and cool the lower levels of the atmosphere such a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow were the result across all of South and Southwest Arkansas.  The transition from freezing rain and sleet to all snow was quick during the morning of January 9th across the region.  The storm system exited the region late on January 9th but not before dumping some impressive freezing rain, sleet and snowfall totals across the southern half of the state.  Generally, one quarter to one half inch of freezing rain and sleet was reported initially across portions of Southwest and South Central Arkansas with the snow being the predominant precipitation type during the afternoon and evening of January 9th.  Following are some snowfall totals for January 9th across South and Southwest Arkansas: 8 inches in Ashdown, 7 inches in Dierks and Nashville, 6 inches in Hope, 6 miles north of Lewisville, and Texarkana, 5 inches in Dequeen and Tolette, 4 inches in Lewisville, 2 inches in Magnolia and 1 inch in El Dorado.  There were numerous reports of traffic accidents across the southern half of the state including isolated power outages as well.",,CSV,

During the morning of the 9th, a mixture of sleet, snow, and freezing rain developed across southern Arkansas. Precipitation spread into central Arkansas before the end of the afternoon, but this far north, temperatures were cold enough such that only snow fell. During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches. On either side of the heavy snow band and from Little Rock toward Brinkley, 4 to 6 inch totals were common. Many other areas received 2 to 4 inches of snow, but amounts in northern Arkansas were less, ranging from less than an inch to 2 inches. In most places, driving conditions became hazardous within a couple of hours after precipitation began. Hundreds of accidents occurred on the afternoon and evening of the 9th. On the afternoon of the 9th, a tremendous traffic back-up occurred on Interstate 30 between Benton and Malvern. Multiple accidents caused both sides of the interstate to come to a halt. Motorists were stranded in the traffic jam for as many as 12 to 14 hours. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe activated the Arkansas National Guard to aid the motorists. Guard armories in Benton and Malvern were opened as shelters. While the interstate technically reopened soon after 7:00 AM CST on the 10th, traffic was still only at a crawl well into the afternoon of the 10th, and traffic was still jammed on the morning of the 11th. Due to the poor driving conditions on the 10th, virtually every school in the Little Rock County Warning Area was closed, as were state and federal offices in Little Rock. Power outages during the winter storm were relatively small. The largest, affecting about 3000 customers, began during the afternoon of the 9th when a substation in southwest Little Rock suffered a failure. Power was restored during the late night hours of the 9th. Twenty-five flights were cancelled at Little Rock's Adams Field. Four traffic fatalities occurred due to icy or snowy roads. On the 9th, three single fatality accidents occurred. A 24 year-old woman was killed on Arkansas Highway 24 near Chidester in Ouachita County, a 42 year-old woman lost her life on U.S. Highway 167 north of Hampton in Calhoun County, and a 31 year-old man was killed on U.S. Highway 70 east of Hot Springs in Garland County.
