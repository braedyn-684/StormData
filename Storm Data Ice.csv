The precipitation was mostly in the form of rain which froze on contact with roadways and exposed surfaces in northern and central sections of the state.  In portions of northern Arkansas, more than an inch of ice was reported...with extensive tree and power line damage. At one point during the evening of the January 1st, up to 85 percent of Boone County had lost power.  It was estimated that up to 100,000 customers were without power during the event. Numerous traffic accidents occurred, but only minor injuries were reported.  However, the ice did claim one life.  A man in Baxter County slipped on the ice while carrying a gun, with the gun accidently firing...killing the man. Warmer air was trying to surge northward during the period, but with slow progress.  From 6pm on January 1st to 12am on January 2nd, the surface temperature at Harrison remained at 30 degrees.  Meanwhile, the temperature at Pine Bluff had climbed from 43 degrees to 53 degrees.  The warmer air would eventually take over, with heavy rain developing across central and southern Arkansas.  Twenty-four hour rainfall totals ending at 6am on the 2nd included 2 to 4 inch amounts generally south of Clarksville, Heber Springs and Newport.

This front edged south into northeast Mississippi by 12 am Thursday, February 3, 2022, and then stalled. Arctic air poured into the Mid-South with patchy light freezing rain across northeast Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel overnight. A potent upper-level disturbance moved into the region and interacted with the stalled front starting early Thursday morning. A surface low developed and moved east-northeast along the front along with a shield of heavy wintry precipitation. The cold air deepened quickly across the Delta region of the Missouri Bootheel, eastern Arkansas, and extreme northwest Tennessee. The region experienced mostly sleet from this event with a widespread amount of one to two inches and isolated three-inch amounts. Transportation impacts were extensive. A corridor of heavy freezing rain was located from Phillips County, AR, through extreme northwest Mississippi, and across much of West Tennessee from Memphis to Brownsville to Paris. These areas received from one-quarter inch to three-quarters inch of ice. Significant damage occurred to the power supply infrastructure throughout this region due to widespread trees and power lines being knocked down. Light icing occurred across other parts of northwest Mississippi such as Clarksdale and along I-40 in West Tennessee to the east of Jackson, Tennessee.  Heavy rain fell along and south of the stalled arctic front across much of north Mississippi. Precipitation tapered off from west to east during the evening hours of Thursday, February 3, 2022.",Around one-quarter inch of ice resulted in tree and power line damage and power outages.,CSV
