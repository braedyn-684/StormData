Heavy snow began in southern and western sections of the state during the morning of the 27th, and gradually spread north and east. By the time the storm was over, 4 to 8 inches of snow had accumulated in about the northern half of the state and along the southern border.  In much of the southern half of the state, 8 to 14 inches of snow was common with isolated reports of 20 inches. It was the most widespead, heavy snow to affect Arkansas since 1988. Due to the snow, more than 600 chicken houses were damaged or destroyed, mostly in the southwest part of the state. Each house held up to 20,000 chickens, with the vast majority of chickens killed when the houses collapsed or because of hypothermia. Due to the loss of poultry, about two dozen counties were declared federal agricultural disaster areas. A hangar at the Benton Airport (Saline County) also collapsed.

The setup was similar to the previous storm, with warm and moist air from the southwest overrunning shallow below freezing air in Arkansas provided by Arctic high pressure. Mostly freezing rain and sleet were noted, with one and a half to 3 inches of ice in western sections of the state and one half to 2 inches of ice elsewhere. The icing was devastating, with about 300,000 customers losing power. Many people were without power for several days. In parts of western Arkansas, there was no water due to power failures and/or generators failing. Hot Springs was the largest city to lose water service.

The system interacted with the front late on the 17th/early on the 18th, with moisture surging northward into the cold air. The cold air was deep enough to support snow in northern Arkansas. Two to as much of six inches of snow was common in about the northern two rows of counties.

Across the northern two rows of counties, ice accumulations were mainly in the 1 to 2 inch range, with a few greater totals at the highest elevations. Elsewhere in northern Arkansas, ice totals in the 1/2 to 1 inch range were more common, with 1/4 to 1/2 inch amounts in west central parts of Arkansas. The snow at the end of the winter weather episode was mainly 1/2 to 1 inch in the north, although there were some totals near 2 inches in counties close to the Missouri border. In the central part of the state, snow totals ranged from a trace to a few tenths of an inch.  ||The ice storm knocked out electricity to more 300,000 electric customers. More than 10,000 power poles were broken or toppled, and hundreds of miles of power lines fell to the ground. Thousands of transformers had to be replaced.

In southern Arkansas, temperatures were just warm enough for the precipitation to fall as rain. However, in central Arkansas, below-freezing temperatures caused freezing rain to break out during the early morning hours. During the first few hours that the precipitation fell, there was some sleet and even scattered thunderstorms. From later into the morning and afternoon, freezing rain and freezing drizzle spread into eastern, north central, and northeastern Arkansas. Although a few icy patches developed on bridges and overpasses during the daylight hours, the vast majority of the ice collected on trees and power lines. By late in the afternoon, some tree branches began to fall and take down some power lines, especially through the central part of the state. Additional rounds of freezing rain and freezing drizzle moved through during the night of the 5th and early on the 6th. Greatest ice accrual was from near Haskell to southwest Little Rock and from south of Lonoke to Carlisle. Driving conditions worsened during the nighttime hours, with many more accidents occurring. After daylight on the 6th, temperatures gradually warmed from south to north, changing the remaining precipitation over to rain and drizzle. By midday on the 6th, no freezing precipitation remained.","Accidents were reported on the Arkansas Highway 321 overpass and where Arkansas Highway 89 crosses over U.S. Highway 67/167.

All precipitation diminished from the evening of the 8th into the early morning hours of the 9th.||Most places in the northern half of Arkansas received at least 3 to 6 inches of snow. In a band about 75 miles wide, centered along a line from Clarksville and Russellville across Greenbrier to between Augusta and Brinkley, snowfall amounts of 6 to 10 inches were common.","Heavy snow fell across much of the county, with amounts of 6 to 8 inches common. Amounts reported included 7 inches at Steprock, 7 inches at Georgetown, and 7.5 inches at Beebe. Precipitation initially fell as snow, then transitioned to a brief mix of snow, sleet and rain during the afternoon hours. The wintry mix then changed back over to all snow by the early evening hours. The heavy snow also caused some damage across the county, with the roof of a gymnasium at Searcy High School collapsing, destroying the building and its contents.",CSV

Precipitation spread into central Arkansas before the end of the afternoon, but this far north, temperatures were cold enough such that only snow fell. During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches.

Precipitation spread into central Arkansas before the end of the afternoon, but this far north, temperatures were cold enough such that only snow fell. During the evening, snow spread into northern Arkansas, and the south saw a changeover to snow. Snowfall was the most widespread and heaviest during the evening hours of the 9th. Soon after midnight, snow tapered off considerably. By dawn on the 10th, only patchy snow flurries and freezing drizzle lingered. The heaviest snow fell in a swath from near Murfreesboro to near Benton, where some amounts reached or exceeded 8 inches. On either side of the heavy snow band and from Little Rock toward Brinkley, 4 to 6 inch totals were common. Many other areas received 2 to 4 inches of snow, but amounts in northern Arkansas were less, ranging from less than an inch to 2 inches. In most places, driving conditions became hazardous within a couple of hours after precipitation began. Hundreds of accidents occurred on the afternoon and evening of the 9th. On the afternoon of the 9th, a tremendous traffic back-up occurred on Interstate 30 between Benton and Malvern. Multiple accidents caused both sides of the interstate to come to a halt. Motorists were stranded in the traffic jam for as many as 12 to 14 hours. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe activated the Arkansas National Guard to aid the motorists. Guard armories in Benton and Malvern were opened as shelters. While the interstate technically reopened soon after 7:00 AM CST on the 10th, traffic was still only at a crawl well into the afternoon of the 10th, and traffic was still jammed on the morning of the 11th. Due to the poor driving conditions on the 10th, virtually every school in the Little Rock County Warning Area was closed, as were state and federal offices in Little Rock. Power outages during the winter storm were relatively small. The largest, affecting about 3000 customers, began during the afternoon of the 9th when a substation in southwest Little Rock suffered a failure. Power was restored during the late night hours of the 9th. Twenty-five flights were cancelled at Little Rock's Adams Field. Four traffic fatalities occurred due to icy or snowy roads. On the 9th, three single fatality accidents occurred. A 24 year-old woman was killed on Arkansas Highway 24 near Chidester in Ouachita County, a 42 year-old woman lost her life on U.S. Highway 167 north of Hampton in Calhoun County, and a 31 year-old man was killed on U.S. Highway 70 east of Hot Springs in Garland County. On the 10th, another single fatality accident occurred, killing a 50 year-old man on Arkansas Highway 86 north of Brown Grove in Prairie County.",Sparkman measured 7 inches of snow.,CSV

During the day, a low pressure center formed along the front, eventually tracking across southeast Arkansas on the evening of the 25th and on toward Middle Tennessee by midnight on the 26th.||During the first part of the 25th, a cold rain fell over most of Arkansas. Then, colder air began spilling into the state to the north and west of the low pressure center's track. Over the northwestern half of Arkansas, a transition from rain to freezing rain, sleet, and some snow occurred during the afternoon, with a changeover to mostly snow by evening. Over the southeastern half of the state, the changeover occurred during the evening, with mostly snow occurring by midnight. Snow began tapering off from the west after midnight, and most of the snow had exited the state by midday on the 26th.||In parts of central and western Arkansas, 0.1 to 0.2 inch of freezing rain accrued before the changeover to snow.||The heaviest band of snow fell from the Ouachita Mountains in west central Arkansas through the central part of the state and then on toward northeastern Arkansas. In this band, snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 inches were common. The largest snowfall totals reported were 18 inches on Petit Jean Mountain (Conway Co.) and at Perryville (Perry Co.), 17.5 inches at Perry (Perry Co.), and 15 inches at Jessieville (Garland Co.) and Union Valley (Perry Co.). Thunderstorms accompanied the snow in many areas. Commerce and transportation were severely affected. Snowfall totals tapered off both to the northwest and southeast of the heaviest band of snow. Parts of northwest Arkansas received less than 1 inch of snow. Likewise, totals were less than 1 inch over a large part of southeast Arkansas.||Strong winds accompanied the winter storm. Sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph were common, and gusts reached 35 to 45 mph in many areas. Near-blizzard conditions occurred in the northeast part of the County Warning Area.||The combination of ice, snow, and wind caused massive power outages. Branches, limbs, and entire trees fell over onto power lines. In the County Warning Area, there were around 200,000 power outages. About 70% of electric customers in Little Rock lost power. Most of the power outages were repaired within a week; cable TV repairs took several days longer.  ||Trees and limbs also fell onto cars and houses. A 60-year-old man was killed in Benton (Saline Co.), when a very large tree crashed into a house. A crane had to be brought in to lift the tree off the victim. In Little Rock, the Public Works Department estimated it could take until summer to collect all the fallen debris, which amounted to about 22,000 tons.||President Barack Obama declared a federal disaster for Garland, Grant, Hot Spring, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski, and Saline Counties.||Numerous snowfall records were broken:||New all-time calendar day snowfall records were set at Perry (Perry Co.) when 17.5 inches of snow broke the record of 10 inches set in 1944, Morrilton (Conway Co.) when 12.5 inches of snow broke the record of 9 inches set in 1944, and at Batesville Livestock Experiment Station (Independence Co.) when 11 inches of snow broke the record of 10 inches set in 2010.

Snow spread across the north/west from the late evening of the 16th into the predawn hours of the 17th. For the remainder of the 17th, central/southern Arkansas got in on the action, and it went nuts from Little Rock (Pulaski County) southward.||Incredibly, about fifteen inches of snow was unleashed near Sheridan (Grant County), with thirteen inches at Malvern (Hot Spring County) and Sulphur Springs (Jefferson County), and about a foot at Gurdon (Clark County), Hope (Hempstead County), and Prescott (Nevada County). Through social media, quite a few pictures were posted of tape measures and rulers penetrating through at least twenty inches of snow (the result of two storms) in yards across the south.||At 230 pm CST...This is not good.

Multiple accidents led to a line of traffic miles long in the westbound lanes that sat for sixteen hours. People were forced to spend the night on the road.||This time around, Little Rock (Pulaski County) was buried with 11.8 inches of snow. At least forty flights into the airport were cancelled on the 17th, and the facility closed during the evening.||Historically, the 17th was the second snowiest day on record at Little Rock (Pulaski County) going back to the late 1800s (in the top spot was 12.0 inches on March 6, 1875). The February tally of 20.3 inches was more than any other month (topping 20.0 inches in January, 1918), and made 2020 the third snowiest year (a foot less than the 32.6 inch record in 1960). The snow depth on the morning of the 18th was 15 inches, which was tied for first place in the record book (with January 21, 1918).||There was enough water to worry about the weight of the snow stressing the roofs of some structures. On the 18th, part of the roof of a volunteer fire department caved in just northeast of Rison (Cleveland County). At Crossett (Ashley County), a bowling alley roof collapsed, and roofs were compromised at a packaging plant and a church. Some of this was attributed to a lot of sleet. Frozen pipes are a common concern in winter, and this became a huge problem in Mayflower (Faulkner County). Supply lines burst, and the city ran out of water. As a safeguard, many folks in central Arkansas were asked to conserve water as pipes thawed out and were subject to pressure breaks. Residents in cities such as Benton (Saline County), Hot Springs (Garland County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County) were urged to cut down on water usage due to a critically low supply. During the evening of the 18th, accidents along Interstate 30 led to tie ups between Benton (Saline County) and Malvern (Hot Spring County).","A COOP observer measured 4.5 inches of snow at 35.86N, -92.11W.",CSV

Residents in cities such as Benton (Saline County), Hot Springs (Garland County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County) were urged to cut down on water usage due to a critically low supply. During the evening of the 18th, accidents along Interstate 30 led to tie ups between Benton (Saline County) and Malvern (Hot Spring County).",A COOP observer measured 8.0 inches of snow.,CSV
