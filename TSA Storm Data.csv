A layer of air several thousand feet above the ground remained above freezing, with very cold air below this layer extending to the ground. This scenario resulted in sleet, which was mixed with snow in northern areas, and mixed with freezing rain in southern areas. Thunderstorms were embedded in this area of precipitation, resulting in heavy accumulation rates. Much of northwestern Arkansas received between one half and two inches of sleet by the late afternoon of the 23rd. Very light snow and freezing drizzle occurred intermittently throughout the early morning hours of the 24th across much of the region. ||A second disturbance approached the area during the morning of the 24th, resulting in another round of sleet and freezing rain.
