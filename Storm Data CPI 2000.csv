At the peak of the winter storm, 8,000 electric customers were without power across northwest Arkansas due to broken power lines caused by weighted-down trees breaking.

A majority of this snow fell in a 48 hour period which caused numerous roofs to collapse including hundreds of chicken houses killing millions of chickens.  Many snowfall records were broken with some records dating back to the late 1800's.  For example, DeQueen, AR set a new 1-day record of 9.5 inches on the 28th.  Hope, AR set a new 1-day record of 15.0 inches on the 28th and a 2-day record of 16 inches which was a combined snowfall total from Jan 27-28.  Records in Hope dated back to 1892.

An estimated 235,000 residents lost electrical power due to ice covered power lines snapping or ice covered trees splitting and falling across the lines.  The was the worst storm in the history of the power companies suppling the power as far as damage but not total ice accumulations.  A total of 29 transmission lines atop ""H"" shaped steel towers were snapped due to the weight of the ice.  Numerous traffic accidents were also reported and many homes suffered damage from fallen trees and tree limbs.  As a result, the Governor of Arkansas declared a State of Emergency for all of southwest Arkansas. Cleanup costs along reached upwards of 15 million dollars.  Several Pine Plantations throughout southwest Arkansas suffered catastrophic damage from the ice storm with upwards of 25 million dollars worth of young trees destroyed.",PDC,72783014.354067

The setup was similar to the previous storm, with warm and moist air from the southwest overrunning shallow below freezing air in Arkansas provided by Arctic high pressure. Mostly freezing rain and sleet were noted, with one and a half to 3 inches of ice in western sections of the state and one half to 2 inches of ice elsewhere. The icing was devastating, with about 300,000 customers losing power. Many people were without power for several days. In parts of western Arkansas, there was no water due to power failures and/or generators failing. Hot Springs was the largest city to lose water service. The Governor's Mansion lost electricity and phone service, with the Governor forced to contact some counties with HAM Radio. Roads became nearly impassible due to the ice and trees that had fallen due to the weight of the ice. The National Guard was contacted to help stranded motorists and to deliver emergency generators. Soldiers driving Humvees had to assist the Little Rock ambulance service...which could not reach patients who lived on steep hills in the western part of the city. FEMA officials, which were due into Arkansas to assess damage from the December 12-13, 2000 Winter Storm could not reach the state. Little Rock National Airport was closed from the evening of the 25th until midday on the 27th due to ice on the runways. This was the first time since 1975 that the airport had been closed for more than 24 hours. Ice Storm Warnings were posted well in advance, with one power company already having 3,000 people on standby in other states before the event began.  This event combined with the event on the 12th and 13th was believed to be the worst natural disaster in Arkansas history.",,PDC,

The precipitation was a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and some light snow northwest of a Texarkana to Prescott Arkansas line while further east the precipitation was all freezing rain.  Ice accumulations of two to four inches were common.  An estimated 235,000 residents lost electrical power due to ice covered power lines snapping or ice covered trees splitting and falling across the lines.  The was the worst storm in the history of the power companies suppling the power as far as damage but not total ice accumulations.  A total of 29 transmission lines atop ""H"" shaped steel towers were snapped due to the weight of the ice.  Numerous traffic accidents were also reported and many homes suffered damage from fallen trees and tree limbs.  As a result, the Governor of Arkansas declared a State of Emergency for all of southwest Arkansas. Cleanup costs along reached upwards of 15 million dollars.

The heavy snow caused roads to become slick and hazardous and several automobiles slid into ditches or into each other.  The heavy snow also caused a few power outages including one that halted service to two hundred customers between Fayetteville and Elkins.
